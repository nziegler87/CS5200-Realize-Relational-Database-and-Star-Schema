# Practicum 2
## Step 1: Design, Implement, and Load a Relational Database using data in XML File
## Step 2: Design, Implement, and Load a Star Schema of the Data with Fact Tables

### Project Overview
For our second practicum, @tolliverdani were provided with an XML file journal and article publication data. We reviewed the provided data and designed and built a relational database hosted on AWS. We then transformed and cleaned the data using XPath queries. After building the relational database, we then were tasked with building a Star Schema using data points of our choosing.
